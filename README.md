# BraggBot
Discord bot written in Java I made in my freetime

I started this project with the intend of learning to work with Java, as I went along with the project more and more additional features
were added to this project, such as the use of web-api's and database management.

## Update and BraggBot's future
It's been a while since I worked on this project, and of course, alot of things have
happened since then, not just in my personal development, but also in all of the libraries
and frameworks I used for this project.

Due to this, I'm unfortunately left with quite an amount of work I'll have to
put in to get this project back on it's feet again, a bit unfortunate...

Couple that with the fact that the discord bot market of today is quite different than the one
when I started work on Braggbot. Nowadays you can go to a wide selection of bot hubs to get
the exact kind of bot you want. It makes it difficult for one's bot to stand out and be unique.

That's why I'm deciding I need to go a different route with Braggbot.

While trimming down or removing unneccesary features,
future development for Braggbot on this branch will mostly be oriented towards these points:
* Entertainment: Think of things like music/games/fun commands/etc...
* The Braggbot framework: Though this project has been dormant for quite a while now
I've always been proud of the command structure of Braggbot, I'm therefore hoping to work on and
refine this in the future
* Multi-guild service: This is the least importand of the three, but still something that has managed
to bug me for quite a while now.

Sorry to bother you with all this reading, it was mostly meant as a personal memo anyway, hi :>.

Ah well, thanks for reading.
