# BraggBot
Discord bot written in Java I made in my freetime

I started this project with the intend of learning to work with Java, as I went along with the project more and more additional features
were added to this project, such as the use of web-api's and database management.

This project is currently in a bit of a hiatus as I am busy working on other projects, but I will probably pick this project back up in
the future as there are still many things i want to add and/or rework in this project.

This project is currently in a bit of a disarray as I am working on a revision of the command framework. This revision
is mostly completed except for a bunch of the different command classes which still need to be adapted to the newer framework.

The previous version of this bot was hosted on a private BitBucket, but due to security issues
~~and totally not me being a dummy and putting sensitive information in the config file~~ I cannot put this version on Github.
